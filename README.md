## Description

This program allows a user to create treats and flavors. Both treats and flavors can be associated with each other, for example the flavor vanilla can be connected with the treat cake. Any user can view the treats, flavors and their details. However to edit, delete, add or otherwise alter treats and flavors, the user must create an account. The website will not allow a user to access those permissions until after an account is registered. After the user registers an account, the will gain access to the edit, delete, create and add pages. If the user tries to access them without creating an account, the site will prompt them to log in, or create an account.
